# NCD_PROJECT
NCD Data Collection App
Project Overview
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases are a major public health concern in India. These diseases account for a significant proportion of mortality and morbidity, especially with rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles. However, there is no comprehensive system in place for collecting reliable and consistent NCD data across different populations.

This project aims to develop a mobile application that facilitates the collection of vital health data related to NCDs. By enabling health workers and individuals to capture and monitor key health metrics, the app will help improve early diagnosis, assess risk factors, and optimize healthcare resources, particularly in underserved and rural areas. The app's goal is to contribute to better health outcomes by enabling targeted interventions and continuous patient care.

Features
Data Collection: Users can input vital health parameters such as blood pressure, glucose levels, cholesterol levels, and more.
User Registration: Healthcare providers and individuals can create accounts to access the app's functionalities.
Risk Assessment: Based on the health data provided, the app performs basic risk analysis to highlight users at high risk of NCDs like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
Data Visualization: Displays data trends and health progress over time to help users track their health.
Offline Access: Supports data collection even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity, with automatic syncing when the connection is restored.
Multi-language Support: Provides accessibility to users in various regional languages to cater to a broader population.
Technologies Used
Front-end: Built using React Native for cross-platform functionality (Android and iOS).
Back-end: Powered by Firebase for real-time database and authentication.
API Integration: To integrate data from external devices or healthcare systems.
Encryption & Data Security: Data is encrypted to ensure patient privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.
